    use each menuItem
  
  cart has view
  
  checkout
  
  individual menu item info
  

put initial menu JSON data into data folder under public directory
  any way to access data folder if its outside public? Or is that why we did back-end
  loading wtih Express, using path.resolve and fs.readFileSync?

  in finished app.
